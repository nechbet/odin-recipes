    <li>Add the chicken thighs into the pot without overlapping. Sear until the bottom turns golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and sear the other side.</li>

    <li>Add the noodles, the green part of the cabbage, and the green part of the green onions. Cook until the noodles heat up and the cabbage turns tender, about 2 minutes. Turn off the heat</li>
    <li>Slice the cooked chicken and place it on top of the noodles.</li>
    <li>Serve hot as a main dish.</li>
